    <string name="menu.info">Hi! My name is Brais Moure, I\'m the Twitimer creator.\n\nThis App has been developed to help Twitch users, but especially thinking about generating educational content for the entire community of programmers interested in the world of apps development for mobile devices. They have made the project possible (I want it to be a free and constantly evolving App).\n\nIf you want to join our community, leave me some kind of suggestion to improve, or support the continuity of the project (a few bits never hurt to pay for the server…), you can find me on Twitch and other social networks as @mouredev.\n\nThank you very much!</string>
